# Movie ETL

## Overview of Movie ETL

### Purpose

This project is an exercise in the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, and contains the following files:

* Deliverable 1: Write an ETL function to read three data files (ETL_function_test.ipynb)
* Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data (ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb)
* Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle Data (ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb) 
* Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database (ETL_create_database.ipynb)

The Resources folder contains the wikipedia.movies.json file, the movies_metadata.csv file, and screenshots movies_query.png and ratings_query.png. 
Please note that the resource files were not in the Resources folder when the code was written, they were in the .../Movies-ETL folder with the .ipynb files. The paths will have to be updated for the code to run correctly.
